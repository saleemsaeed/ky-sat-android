     KySat-2 (Kentucky Satellite 2):\n
     Launched 11/19/2013 from Wallops Island Virginia
     Orbit 500 km by 40.6 degree inclination
     KySat-2 is a 1U CubeSat fulfilling the original educational outreach and
    technology demonstrator goals of KySat-1 while additionally testing a
    attitude determination system that uses the satellites existing camera.
    The spacecraft transmitted at 437.405 MHz and can be tracked by amateur
    radio stations.

    <string name="AboutB2">
    The CubeLab® research platform was born out of a need for repeatable/affordable research on the International Space Station (ISS). Kentucky Space hardware designs fit a variety of platforms on suborbit vehicles, free-flying orbiting CubeSats and ISS platforms. By providing a standardized platform and open architecture for the experimental modules, we shrink the development cycle and cost for research and development, which leads to whole new products and markets.

    What can we learn by removing gravity from the equation?
    </string>


    <string name="AboutB3">
    During their evolution over billions of years, the form and function of all organisms on Earth have adapted to the force of Earth’s gravity and these characteristics are encoded in their genes: up-down asymmetry, structural strength, size of force-producing elements and sensory systems. By eliminating gravity, cells, molecules, protein crystals, microbes, etc. behave in very different ways. This presents opportunities to explore new and potentially game-changing discoveries in areas such as human tissue regeneration, drug development and treatments for diseases such as cancer and other life threatening and chronic conditions, as well as energy and novel materials.
